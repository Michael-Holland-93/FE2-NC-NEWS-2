After selecting a topic there is a button to add an article, the two fields above must be filled in first which are article title and article body. At the bottom of each of these pages there are buttons to either go to the next page or to the previous page of articles, these buttons will no longer work when there are no more articles to display.

There are buttons to vote on the articles to give a positive or negative review about them depending on your opinion. There is a button to delete the article, upon clicking this the webpage will then reload the homepage.
